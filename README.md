# DS1624
Arduino library for Maxim DS1624 temperature sensor and memory https://www.technologytourist.com/electronics/2017/11/02/DS1624-arduino-library.html

The DS1624 consists of two separate functional units: a 256-byte nonvolatile memory and a direct-to-digital temperature sensor.

The nonvolatile memory is made up of 256 bytes, accessed through the 2-wire serial bus.

The direct-to-digital temperature sensor allows the DS1624 to measure the ambient temperature and report the temperature in a 12-bit word with 0.0625Â°C resolution. The temperature sensor and its related registers are accessed through the 2-wire serial interface.
